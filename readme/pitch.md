# Working Title: Vampire O'Clock
> Arise, fledgling, and prove your worth.

VOC is a stealth-centered narrative driven game set in an ambiguous low fantasy city. The mood is dark and brooding. The player controls a newly sired vampire struggling with what this means. Thematically we are grounded by Nietzsche’s well known quote from Beyond Good and Evil: _He who fights with monsters might take care lest he thereby become a monster. And if you gaze for long into an abyss, the abyss gazes also into you._

Potential motivations or conflict for the main character are:
- loss of faith
- exploration of humanity / depravity
- revenge or redemption

### Gameplay
The story is told through dialogue and item descriptions as we are extremely limited on art resources. We may have a simplistic combat system but the main character is a vampire who will be more powerful than almost any natural opponent they encounter...

### Mechanics
This means that mechanically the player will often have two options to face problems: the easy way that drives them into vampirism (the “bad” ending?) or the stealthy way that lets them preserve their humanity (the “good” ending?). There should be some situations that force a specific solution (e.g. player has no choice but to use superior strength to break through a wall).

**Stats**  
During play there are three stats to monitor

1. Hit points – if these hit 0 you go into torpor and presumably are found and killed; can be drained by being attacked or caught in the sun. Regenerates slowly over time or quickly by drinking blood when hunger is full.
2. Hunger – depletes at a rate that depends on how given over you are to your vampiric powers, if it drops to 0 you become overcome with rage and either the elder vampires subdue you or the townfolk pitchfork you. Regenerates by drinking blood. If you drink blood without hunger, e.g., to heal it deepens the pull of your vampiric powers, e.g., hunger increases more quickly.
3. “Vampire Juice” / mana – used to fuel your powers. Regenerates by drinking blood when hunger and hit points are full.

**Powers**  
1. Speed – basically a roll with i-frames; the most basic power used to get out of danger or navigate sun bathed areas if necessary
2. Strength – extra powerful hit (and/or) one-hit kill
3. Compulsion – forces somebody to do a thing that you need / forget you exist / etc
4. Heal – heals wounds on demand
5. other?

Each of these require some amount of mana to use. Each use provides experience for that skill. When a skill levels up it uses more mana and may or may not become more powerful. Becoming more vampiric isn’t necessarily a good thing.

### Challenges
- Sun – getting caught in the sun will cause quite dramatic damage draining hit points and increasing hunger
- The day – we will have a day/night cycle on an interval that provides a dynamic challenge to outdoor exploration
- Guards – not “danger” in the sense that one can hurt you initially but can drive you to use powers to reach safety or kill them; eventually they may use blessed/silver weapons and cause meaningful damage
- Yourself – hunger
- Potentially other vampires? TBD plot dependent
- Puzzles – lock & key driver either by dialogue/plot or exploration to find keys
